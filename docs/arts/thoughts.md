# Thoughts, on aesthetics

- 20260208: Lau Noah, nice very weird music I would say, that counterpointy things are quite trippy and fuguesque
- 20260208: Paco de Lucia is unbelievable, gotta buy a couple of albums
- 20260204: Antoine Boyer - cool guitar
- 20260203: The invetion of lying (movie, ricky gervais), is lying creation? i thought that creativity was more about interpretation of reality from a personal point of view, but what about a lie, coming up with something that is not your interpetation but you can make others believe that it is, is that actual creation?
