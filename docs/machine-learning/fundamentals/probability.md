## Probability distribuition

From what a probability distribution is just a function that maps the possible outcome to its probability. It makes sense that the total probability (the integral I guess) is 1. In the case of a continuous domain it feels a bit weird, I guess that in that case you always integrate and the probability is actually the area(?). 

## Uniform distribution

Well this is just flat, every result is equally probable.

## Entropy

## Perplexity
