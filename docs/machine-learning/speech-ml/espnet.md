End to end speech processing toolkit is a collection of models for speech processing, supposedly state of the art. from what i understand there's a recipe yaml, one specifies the details of the model and than can proceed with training on clusters and stuff like that. Runs around this config anv various .sh files. Worth exploring and asking about.
