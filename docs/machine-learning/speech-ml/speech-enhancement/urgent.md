# URGENT

urgent is an annual challenge for speech enhancement models, it's usually held at ICASSP or Interspeech. It's probably a good place to check for the state of the art and metrics to measure it

Results will be out in may, but the baseline is one flowmatching and the other bandsplit RNN (bi-lstm on complex spectrum)
