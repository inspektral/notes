# GIT

Well i don't know shit about, git, I should learn some more, it could come in very handy.

- `git clone <repo-link> <target-folder>` download repo from the internets

- `git pull` download updates from the online repo

- `git push` push updates to online repo

What does origin mean?

- `git branch` see local branches
- `git branch -r` see remote branches
- `git checkout <branch-name>` switch branch

And all the other things
